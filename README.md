# Automatic-Water-Tap-controller-
This project aims to reduce the loss of water in daily life while using water taps as well as bring automation our life.
Our system will automatically open the water tap by sensing the presence of object below the tap.
For sensing the presence of object we have used sonar sensor. And to open the water tap we have used servo motor.
Our system automatically close the tap when the object is removed . 
Thus it will make our life a lot easier and also reduce water loss.
